### Introduction

In this project I am implementing an extended version of the usual calculator, which can be found in the standard applications of each operating system in the C programming language using structured programming. 
In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, i supplement the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). 
Besides calculating expressions, it also support the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.
